opennaas-dc-gui
===============

Example interface for operating the OpenNaaS REST interface.

This interface is written as an example to demonstrate the capabilities of OpenNaaS to function as a tool for administrating network elements in a datacenter.

Prerequisites
-------------

This applications uses Python and requires a working instance of OpenNaaS 0.28<br>
To download and install OpenNaaS, visit http://opennaas.org/downloads/ <br>
Or alternatively the github repository https://github.com/dana-i2cat/opennaas/ <br>
It can run as a standalone WSGI app.
It requires a number of packages:<br>

<pre>
sudo apt-get install python-paramiko
sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev
sudo apt-get install libxslt1-dev
sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev build-essential 
sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo pip install Flask
sudo pip install requests
sudo pip install ncclient==0.3.2
sudo pip install ciscoconfparse
</pre>

Installation
------------

1. Clone the opennaas-dc-gui repository somewhere on your server.
2. adjust the settings.py file to match your environment.
3. execute the app using ./opennaas_dc_gui.wsgi
4. Adjust rpc.py in ncclient module. (see below here)

#### Issues using Cisco netconf ####

the ncclient library has issues handling correct XML namespace for Cisco.
This means that when sending an RPC call, the RPC call is not ended correctly, and the session stays open.
Manual patch in operations/rpc.py to fix this:

<pre>
line 181-182:
- if tag != qualify("rpc-reply"):
-     return
+ # if tag != qualify("rpc-reply"):
+ #    return
</pre>

Current functionality
---------------------

Overview page:
- Provides overview of all resources
- starting and stopping single / group of resourcesÂ 
- Remove single / group of resources (works, but does not correctly show resources afterwards)

Overview Network page:
- List all VLANs found in all resources, list on which resources the vlans are configured

Topology page:
- Shows the topology of the network as managed by OpenNaaS
- Allows naviagtion to specific resources

Queue overview:
- List all queue items of all resources

Resource Chassis page:
- Provides overview of all interfaces of a resource
- Add / Change interface description
- Add / Change interface IPv4 address
- Add / Change interface IPv6 address
- Bring interface / group of interfaces up / down
- Review Aggregated links information

Resource Queue page:
- lists all individual queue actions of a resource
- remove single / group of queue actions
- Clear /execute queue 

Resource info page:
- List Resource protocol context information

Note: Currently only Juniper EX and M series routers are supported using the router resource.

Local resources
---------------
A separate module described by 'local resources' allows you to access cisco routers / switches using NETCONF, which are not managed in OpenNaaS.
It allows the following basic functionality:
- Overview of interface status, interface description, vlan tagging and detected MAC addresses
- Changing of interface administrative status, interface description and vlan tagging.
- Changes are queued using a local queuing mechanism.
